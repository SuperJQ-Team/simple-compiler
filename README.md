# simple-compiler
A simple compiler for easy calculation
(maybe)

最开始它只是一个普通的计算器，但后来它变的越来越像一个解释器了…… 
除了基本的运算和矩阵运算外，它还支持位运算、定义变量甚至自定义函数. 
同样你也可以将指令储存在.cgl文件中并用计算器执行它. 

At first it was just an ordinary calculator, but then it became more and more like an interpreter... 
In addition to basic operations and matrix operations, it also supports bitwise operations, defining variables and even custom functions. 
You can also store the instruction in a .cgl file and execute it with a calculator.
